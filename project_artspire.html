		<p>Although best known for his powerhouse role in Queen, Roger Taylor is anything but a drummer confined to his kit. With rock n¡¯roll in his veins all through his schooldays, he has always been a highly active, vocal member of Queen. He famously wrote Queen¡¯s landmark hits Radio Ga Ga and A Kind Of Magic, and was also the first to make a solo album, 1981¡¯s Fun In Space. To date he has released 5 solo albums, which, aside from his work with Queen, further highlighted Taylor as an musician and writer with a strong sense of identity, a wide musical perspective, and - not least of all - a man not without a sense of irony. Just consider, for instance, the lyrics to I¡¯m In Love With My Car, his B side to Bohemian Rhapsody, and a firm audience favourite in the Queen live set.</p>

		<p>Taylor¡¯s active approach has not been confined to his music: when media mogul Rupert Murdoch made attempts to buy Manchester United football club, Taylor funded the club supporters in their attempts to block the sale, and historically helped them succeed.</p>

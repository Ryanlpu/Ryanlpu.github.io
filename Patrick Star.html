<B> Patrick Star </B> </FONT> 
<P> Pink starfish. The intelligence quotient is extremely low, the mind and the body only use the plug connection. Everything would be messed up, but the boat was extremely powerful, living under a large round stone. He is lazy and childish. He often dribbles unconsciously. He hates to take a bath, doesn't like to wash his hands, and prefers to sleep. The interest is watching TV. The best relationship with SpongeBob; and often encourage SpongeBob to make some dangerous actions, often let each other into trouble. </P>

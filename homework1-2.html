      <p>Mu Zhiben Ying is a fourth grade student who is good at sports. One day, Xiao Ying came home from school and found that there seemed to be someone in her underground study. Sakura went down to have a look. There was a Book shining with golden light. There are cards inside. However, when reading and writing the words on it, there is a strong wind, and the cards are flying around. At the end of the book, there is a wonderful creature named koruberos, which says, "when the seal of the Kulo card is untied, disaster will come to the world.". Then, koruberos will seal the key to small Sakura, so that she became a card collector. That night, Sakura uses magic to fight against the materialized magic card.</p>
    
      <p>Sakura is recognized as the new owner of the "Kuluo card". At the beginning of the new semester, a strange transfer student named Xinze Elio came to Xiao Ying's class. From that time on, strange things began to happen again in Yukichi. With a new wand, Sakura wants to transform Kuluo into Sakura.</p>

<P> Cakes are made from various combinations of refined flour, some form of shortening, sweetening, eggs, milk, leavening agent, and flavoring.  There are literally thousands of cakes recipes (some are bread-like and some rich and elaborate) and many are centuries old.  Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure. </P> 
<P> Baking utensils and directions have been so perfected and simplified that even the amateur cook may easily become and expert baker. T here are five basic types of cake, depending on the substance used for leavening.  </P>
